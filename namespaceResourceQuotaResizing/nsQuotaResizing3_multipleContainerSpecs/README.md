# Namespace Resource Quota Resizing With Multiple Container Specs

Namespace has 2 container specs, each with one container. One has CPU highly utilized and the other has CPU under utilized:

```
Namespace:
- CPU limit quota capacity: 1000m
- CPU limit quota used: 1000m

- ContainerSpec1:
    - Container:
        - CPU limit: 500m
        - Desired CPU limit from Turbo analysis: 800m
- ContainerSpec2:
    - Container:
        - CPU limit: 500m
        - Desired CPU limit from Turbo analysis: 300m
```

- With namespace reisizing support, 
    - in plan, as we simulate all container resizing actions, namespace quota resizing action will **NOT** be generated.
    - in real time, we'll generate following actions:
```
- Resize namespace from 1000m to 1300m
- Resize container1 from 500m to 800m (not executable)
```

### Note
Note that this is to mainly test the scenario where there're both container resize up and down actions in the same namespace with resource quota full. The amount of resizing up and amount of resizing down may not be the same depending on the underlying nodes. The guaranteed result is that:
- in real time, namespace resizing up will be generated by the total amount of container resizing up;
- in plan, namespace resizing up may or may not be generated based on the total amount of container resizing up and down.
